## Description

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/master/source/ChatGPT.popclipext/ChatGPT-demo.gif" width="480px">

The main action, **Chat**, sends the selected text to OpenAI's ChatGPT and
appends the response as a new line.

As a modifier, if you hold the Shift (â‡§) key while invoking the action, the
response will be copied to the clipboard instead of appended to the selection.

The previous messages in the chat are sent along with each new message, allowing
an extended dialogue with the AI.

The **Reset** action (broom icon) clears the current chat history to start a
fresh conversation.

### Configuration
